# Payroll Management System

A basic payroll management application built with Angular and Material 3, demonstrating best practices in enterprise application development with a feature-based architecture.

## Overview

This application serves as a demonstration of modern Angular development techniques, featuring a scalable architecture, reactive state management using signals, and a clean, user-friendly interface built with Angular 19 and Material 3. The system allows for managing employee data, processing payroll, tracking pay periods, and generating detailed reports and visualizations.

## Features

- **Employee Management**: Add, edit, and manage employee profiles with detailed information
- **Pay Period Administration**: Create and manage custom pay periods
- **Payroll Processing**: Process payroll for specific periods with automatic calculations
- **Payslip Generation**: Generate detailed payslips for employees
- **Visual Analytics**: Track payroll trends with interactive charts
- **Filtering & Search**: Powerful filtering and search capabilities
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works across devices

## Architecture

The application follows a feature-based architecture, which promotes:

- **Modularity**: Features are encapsulated in standalone components and services
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with dedicated services for specific functions
- **Scalability**: Easy addition of new features without affecting existing ones
- **Reusability**: Common functionality extracted into shared components and services

### Key Architectural Aspects

- **Signals for Reactivity**: Using Angular's signals API for reactive state management
- **Service-Oriented Design**: Business logic encapsulated in dedicated services
- **Component Composition**: Complex UI built from smaller, reusable components
- **Material Design**: Consistent and modern UI with Angular Material 3
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: JSDoc comments throughout codebase for better maintainability

## Technology Stack

- **Angular 19+**: Latest version with standalone components and control flow
- **Angular Material 3**: UI component library
- **Chart.js**: For data visualization
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Reactive Forms**: For robust form handling
